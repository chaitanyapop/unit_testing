We have the example of getAllByRole and geByRole. Similarly, we have other functionalities as well to select the element from the Dom

1) getByLabelText/getAllByLabelText- In this RTL query our label is associated with a particular input box or any other element. We have
"htmlFor" attribute to associate it with particular DOM element. Using this we can get a DOM element using the text which we write
inside the label tag e.g <label>hello</label>. In case of getAllByLabelText we get the data in the form of an array.

2) getByPlaceholder/getAllByPlaceholder- In this RTL query we get the data or DOM element when we put the placeholder value inside it.
The placeholder value is mainly present in the input box or in text box and using that placeholder value we can get the DOM element.
getAllByPlaceholder is mainly used to get the data in the form of an array for multiple elements and we can process them using a for loop

3)getByText/getAllByText- In this we get the data/DOM element using the text present inside the tags. E.g <p>Hello world</p> now inside 
the P tag we have Hello world text then using that we can get the DOM element

4)getByTestId/getAllByTestId- This is also same to get the data using the test ID

5)getByDisplayedValue/getAllByDisplayedValue- This RTL query mainly used to get the DOM element based on the value of it. If we have
given a default value to any element which is mainly an input element or any other as well then based on value parameter we can 
fetch the DOM element. getAllByDisplayedValue will return a data in an array format.

6)getByTitle/getAllByTitle- This RTL query mainly used to get the data on the basis of the title given the particular tag. If inside a tag
I have given a title attribute which helps us to give a name when we hover on a element using a mouse. In getAllByTitle we get the DOM
elements in the form of an array and we can test them using a for loop

7)getAltText/getAllByAltText- This attribute "alt" is mainly used inside an image tag. When image is not loaded then the alternate text of
it will get displayed. To fetch the DOM element on the basis of "alt" attribute we can use the mentioned RTL query. To get multiple 
DOM elements we can use getAllByAltText and we can process them using a for loop
