In unit testing there are ways to store the test files and the naming conventions are mentioned below.

1) file_name.test.js
2)file_name.spec.js
3)file_name.spec.jsx
4)file_name.test.jsx

By using above mentioned extentions we can store the particular file file_name

Now there is another way to store the test files.

If we create the __test__ folder and below it if we store any .js or above mentioned extentions file then automatically it will be 
treated as a test file.
